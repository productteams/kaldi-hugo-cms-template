        We believe that good stain has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow wood lovers and learn about
        wood staining techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
